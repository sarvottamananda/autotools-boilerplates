## Autotools-boilerplates : Some boilerplates for autotools projects


# Installation instructions

In each of the boilerplates, you copy the whole subdirectory, and run autogen.sh as follows:

```
$ bash autogen.sh
```

# Cleaning

Warning: You should not run clean-all.sh if you have created/modified something important in the boilerplate. You are
being warned. It is there to check if the boilerplates are the bare minimum.

The script clean=all.sh removes the generated files.

```
$ bash clean-all.sh
```
